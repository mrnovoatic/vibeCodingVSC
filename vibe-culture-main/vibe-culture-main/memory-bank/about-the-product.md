# VibeCulture - Hyper-Local Cultural Event Discovery Platform

**Prompt for Developing a Hyper-Local Cultural Event Discovery Website**

Build a minimal viable product (MVP) for a hyper-local cultural event discovery website that addresses the pain points of fragmented event information, poor discoverability of niche cultural events, choice overload, and lack of trust in event quality. The platform will serve urban users (primarily 18–55 years old) seeking authentic cultural experiences, such as art exhibitions, music performances, theater, festivals, and workshops, in a specific city or region. The website will curate high-quality, community-validated events, offer personalized recommendations, and provide a simple, mobile-friendly interface to enhance discoverability and user engagement. The MVP will focus on one city to keep development lean, with potential to scale to other regions later.

**Main Features**:  
1. **Event Aggregation and Curation**:  
   - Aggregate events from reliable sources (e.g., local venues, community submissions, or APIs like Eventbrite, if feasible).  
   - Support manual event submissions from organizers, with basic moderation to ensure quality and relevance (no spam or overly commercial listings).  
   - Focus on hyper-local cultural events (e.g., within one city) to maintain a manageable scope.  

2. **Simple Search and Filter Interface**:  
   - Allow users to search events by location, date, event type (e.g., music, art, theater), and price (free or paid).  
   - Highlight free or low-cost events to attract budget-conscious users.  
   - Ensure a mobile-friendly, intuitive design for on-the-go access.  

3. **Personalized Recommendations**:  
   - Enable users to create a basic profile and select interests (e.g., jazz, visual art, cultural festivals) for tailored event suggestions.  
   - Include a “surprise me” feature that recommends one unique weekly event based on user preferences or trending local events.  

4. **Community Validation**:  
   - Allow users to upvote or leave short comments on events to indicate popularity or quality.  
   - Display a “community pick” badge for highly rated events to build trust and guide user decisions.  

5. **Event Details and Actionability**:  
   - Provide clear event pages with essential details: date, time, location (with map integration), price, and links to buy tickets or RSVP.  
   - Include options to save events to a personal calendar or share via social media/email for easy planning and promotion.
