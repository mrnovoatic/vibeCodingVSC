One of my biggest fights while hashtag#vibecoding with AI is keeping consistency.

When I ask the AI to write some code, it will write it in a different way than it did yesterday, or it will duplicate code, or use a new design pattern or a new approach! 😡

🔥 One of the most efficient tricks so far to avoid that, is to take the time to ask the AI to write some rules that apply to the most important files. 

For example: You probably have 5-10 files that are VERY IMPORTANT, we usually call this files "Managers" or "Controllers,” “Coordinators,” “Services,” or even “Core Modules,” depending on the architecture. The name isn’t as important as their role: they’re the files that orchestrate the logic, glue components together, and keep everything humming.

For each of these files you will have one rule file that describe its responsibilities, design patterns, integration patterns, naming conventions, etc.

Of course you are not writing this rules either, the AI will write this for you.

Attached are some examples.
