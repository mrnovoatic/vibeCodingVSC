The main goal of this article should be explaining how Windsurf is different than Cursor with its features because they seem the same or similar at the beginning. Once you understand the difference between them, you can better make a decision. 

I also want to talk about very specific features that Windsor has that Courser doesn't have. 

We should also mention how those features make you be a developer in a different way with a different focus than the Courser ones. 

Honorable mention can be given to the integration between Windsurf and Nutlify that makes deployment supposedly way faster, better, and easier. 

Another topic should be how WinServe has this tool where you can click on elements on the UI, on the HTML/CSS of your actual website, and refer to them on the chat. That makes it way easier for debugging or making new improvements. 

We should also mention that Windsurf doesn't prioritize integration with VSCode workflows as its main feature. This may cause it to differ more and more from the original VSCode workflows, integrating unique things and reducing compatibility backwards. 

We should mention that it's more beginner-friendly and that it has less control over what you are coding because it's meant to be updating several files at once in something that they call cascading. 

Ã¥We should also mention that it's faster than a cursor in its operation.
