Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that helps you write, edit, and debug code faster and more efficiently than -almost- any other tool out there. Built on top of VSCode (which we'll discuss more later), Cursor combines the familiar interface of a modern code editor (like VSCode) with powerful AI capabilities that understand your code and help automate repetitive tasks. 

In this lesson we will go over the key features you need to master about Cursor and set you up for the most successful [vibe coding with AI](https://4geeks.com/bootcamp/vibe-coding-with-ai).

## Why Cursor Stands Out

- **Fork of VSCode**: Being a fork of the most popular code editor in the world, Cursor is built on top of the same technology that powers VSCode. This means hundreds of plugins and extensions are compatible with Cursor. Enterprises and companies use VSCode and now Cursor to code.
- **Cursor Agent Mode**: Cursor's Agent Mode is a feature that allows the AI agent to basically take control of your code editor and do things like create files, update previous files, execute terminal commands, and more. This was not possible with other editors but now its being replicated everywhere.
- **Cursor Rules**: Another featured invented by Cursor is the ability to create rules for the AI agent to follow. This allows you to customize the AI to your needs. This makes coding with AI 10x more efficient and enjoyable. I could not imagine coding without cursor rules.
- **Rate of improvement**: These people don't sleep. They release feature after feature and the competitors can't keep up, using other cools like the famouse Githhub Copilot feels like being 6 months behind.

## Key Features for an Efficient Workflowx

### 1. Cursor Composer in Agent Mode

We start with Composer in Agent Mode because it's the most important feature of Cursor. It's a feature that allows the AI agent to basically take control of your code editor and do things like create files, update previous files, execute terminal commands, and more. This was not possible with other editors but now its being replicated everywhere. I would strongly recommend you to master this feature, its the main way I use it every day.

### 2. Intelligent Auto-Completion

Cursor’s autocomplete system is 10x better than any other editor out there (belive me, I've tried them all). As you type, it predicts what you’re aiming for and offers suggestions to speed up your coding. But these suggestions are not just on your current line of code, it will also predict what you're going to type next based on the context of the code you've written and show a little "tab" icon to let you know that it will autocomplete the rest of the code for you.

*With Cursor, typing out that `console.log(greet("World"));` might take just a few keystrokes as it predicts and fills in for you.*

### 3. Cursor Rules

Cursor Rules are this awesome feature that allows you to create files that tell the AI what to do in every possible scenario.

You can create as many rules as you want, all you do is create a folder .cursor/rules and create a file for each rule, these files need to end with the .mdc extension, and you walso have to set the file extensions in which the rule will apply.

### 4. Providing Context to Cursor

This was Cursor's beast feature until agent mode came out. Cursor is amazing at absorbing context because it makes pretty easy for developers to provide that context. When you are chatting or talking to the composer you can use the at symbol `@` to mention so many things:

- @file: Mention a specific file
- @folder: Mention a specific folder
- @docs: You can add specific oficial documentations and cursor will save them for later, then you can reference them in your conversation with the agent.
- @git: If connects with your github account, you can mention a specific repository and cursor will use the files from that repository to answer your question. 
- @codebase: You can tell cursor to read your entire codebase and use it to answer your question.
- @web: You can tell cursor to search the web for information and use the search results as context.

### 5. Ignoring files

> I would recommend this feature only if you have a huge codebase with thousands of files.

You can tell cursor to ignore specific files or folders by adding them to the .cursorignore file. This is useful to avoid the AI to use specific files as context. The .cursorignore file works very similar to the .gitignore file.

## Practical Tips for Beginners

- **Customize Your Setup**: Tweak theme, font size, and keybindings to match your preference. A cozy environment keeps you in the coding flow.
- **Add your cursor rules**: Create a folder .cursor/rules and create a file for each rule, these files need to end with the .mdc extension, and you walso have to set the file extensions in which the rule will apply.
- **Use Extensions**: Browse and install extensions for your language of choice—extra tools for linting, formatting, or testing are never a bad thing.
- **Take Advantage of Shortcuts**: Cursor supports a variety of keyboard shortcuts that streamline tasks. Hitting fewer keys means saving more time!

## Wrapping Up

Cursor is rethinking the way we code by enabling AI's real power. By mastering features like Agent Mode, intelligent auto-completion, Cursor Rules, and context management, you'll find yourself coding faster and more efficiently than ever before.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, Cursor's AI-powered features can significantly enhance your productivity while maintaining the flexibility and control you need. As AI continues to evolve, Cursor stands at the forefront of this transformation in software development.

Give it a try, experiment with its features, and discover how it can revolutionize your coding experience. Happy coding!
