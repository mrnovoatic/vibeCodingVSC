# Vibe Coding Security Checklist

Building secure applications doesn't have to be complicated. Follow this checklist to protect your app and your users from common security vulnerabilities.

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **Use a Battle-Tested Auth Library**
  
  Don't build auth from scratch — it's fragile and risky. Use trusted libraries like Clerk to handle password hashing, sessions, MFA, etc.

- [ ] **Lock Down Protected Endpoints**
  
  Every server request must verify user identity. This blocks unauthorized access and helps prevent abuse or DDoS. Clerk's SDK makes this dead simple.

- [ ] **Use Middleware Auth Checks**
  
  Middleware = your app's security gatekeeper. Only let valid, authenticated users through before hitting routes.

- [ ] **Add Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  
  Not all users are equal. Use roles like admin, user, guest to restrict access to features and routes accordingly.

## Secrets Management

- [ ] **Never Expose Secrets on the Frontend**
  
  Your API keys, DB credentials, and tokens should NEVER touch client-side code. Store them in .env files — server only.

- [ ] **Git Ignore Sensitive Files**
  
  Add .env and any other secret-containing files to .gitignore. You don't want to leak secrets on GitHub by accident.

## Error Handling & Data Security

- [ ] **Sanitize Your Error Messages**
  
  Never expose raw backend errors to the client. They leak internal logic and give attackers clues. Log the details on the server, send only friendly messages to users.

- [ ] **Use Secure DB Libraries or Platforms**
  
  Raw SQL queries = high risk of SQL injection. Use an ORM or a managed DB platform like Supabase, which supports Row-Level Security out of the box.

## Infrastructure & Transport Security

- [ ] **Host on a Secure Platform**
  
  Pick platforms with baked-in security: Vercel, AWS, Google Cloud. They offer DDoS protection, SSL, firewalls, and auto-patching.

- [ ] **Enable HTTPS Everywhere**
  
  Always enforce HTTPS using SSL certificates. Never allow HTTP traffic in production. Browsers and users expect encrypted communication by default.

- [ ] **Limit File Upload Risks**
  
  If users can upload files, scan them for malware, validate file types, and restrict file sizes. Never trust file uploads blindly — it's a common attack vector.
