Lets take some time to digest these facts:

- Developers that effectively leverage AI tools in their workflow are up to 50% more productive.
- Thanks to AI, you can finally build a product in week and start making money, faster than it will take you to get a job.
- "Vibe Coding" has already generated hundreds of thousands to people that started building just a few weeks ago, its a new economy!

I'm seeing this revolution firsthand. Today, 90% of the code I write is generated by AI, and I've several successful products using this approach. The shift is happening right now, and those who master this skill early will have an extraordinary advantage in the tech industry.

## Stop thinking about coding in the same way

When see someone say "AI will take developers jobs", all I see is someone without vision.

We're living through a fundamental transformation in how software is built. The recent advancements in AI have created a completely new paradigm for coding—one that's not just about "automating" repetitive tasks like coders did before, but about forming a creative partnership with AI systems.

It's a complete reimagining of what it means to be a developer. Just as the transition from assembly to high-level languages changed programming forever, AI-assisted coding is creating a similar shift in our industry.

## Are you afraid or resent AI? Or willing to join the revolution?

I get that some people are proud of the hard work it took them to learn everthing they know, let them be proud.

In the mean time, let's get good at this game!

1. The window of competitive advantage is open but won't stay open forever
2. Current educational resources often miss the holistic approach needed to truly "vibe" with AI
3. Many developers are struggling with imposter syndrome as they see AI generating code they once prided themselves on writing manually

### The "Vibe Coding" Difference

Vibe Coding isn't just about using AI to generate snippets—it's about developing a symbiotic relationship with AI systems where both your human creativity and the AI's computational power work together seamlessly. It's about knowing:

- When to rely on AI and when to code manually
- How to craft prompts that leverage AI's strengths
- Which parts of development still require human expertise
- How to maintain technical mastery while using AI
- What to build: There are things we can build, that we could not build before AI. New markets!

## Why I'm the Right Person to Guide You

My journey with code began 25 years ago, long before AI assistants were even imaginable. I've built mission-critical infrastructure, including prison management systems in Mexico and social security administration systems in Venezuela. This deep foundation in traditional coding gives me the perspective to understand what's truly changing with AI.

In 2014, I transformed 4Geeks into a full tech school, which is now recognized by Forbes.com, Fortune.com, and Newsweek.com as one of the world's top coding institutions. We've trained more than 5,000 developers from scratch, giving me unique insights into how people learn to code—and how that process is evolving with AI. And we recently launched 4Geeks.com the first AI-First learning platform for tech skills.

My experience creating LearnPack (https://learnpack.co/), an AI-powered educational platform with hundreds of thousands of users, and Rigobot, an AI coding mentor, has given me practical expertise in building AI educational tools that actually work.

Perhaps most importantly, I've been experimenting with AI-assisted coding approaches since the early days, refining techniques that combine human creativity with AI capabilities. The methods I'll teach you aren't theoretical—they're battle-tested approaches I use daily to ship products efficiently.
