# Understanding Cursor Rules

If you are reading this, you already know what is cursor and you are starting to go all in into coding with AI.

## What Are Cursor Rules?

This is the best to you have available to make the AI write the code the way you want, you can think about it as a linter on steroids.

## Why Use Cursor Rules?

They make coding easier and less annoying! Without rules, the AI might spit out code that’s close to what you want but not quite there. With cursor rules, you can tweak it to fit your vibe. Want shorter answers? Done. Prefer a certain way of writing functions? You got it. It’s like customizing your own coding sidekick.

## How to Use Cursor Rules

Setting up cursor rules with the `.cursor/rules` folder is super easy, even if you’re just starting out. Here’s the step-by-step:

1. **Create a `.cursor/rules` folder**: In your project’s main folder (aka the “root” where all your project stuff lives), make a new folder called `.cursor/rules`.

Right-click in the folder, pick “New Folder,” and name it `.cursor/rules`. That dot at the start is normal—don’t skip it! Is meant to keep the .cursor filder hidden int he file system.

2. **Add rule files**: Inside `.cursor/rules`, create little text files for your instructions. Name them whatever you want, but they need to end with `.rule` (like `general.rule` or `no-comments.rule`).

Right-click in the folder, pick “New File,” and give it a name like `my-rule.rule`.

3. **Write your rules**: Open a `.rule` file with any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, or Cursor itself) and add your instructions. Keep it simple, like:
   - In `no-comments.rule`: `Do not include comments in the generated code.`  
   - In `naming.rule`: `Use camelCase for all variable names.`  
   Each file can focus on one idea or rule.

4. **Save it**: Save your files, and you’re good to go! The next time you use Cursor’s AI in your project, it’ll follow these rules.

> 📝 Quick note: The `.cursor/rules` setup is newer (you may see some people use the old .cursorrules file) and lets you organize rules into separate files, which is great if you want to keep things tidy.

## Simple Examples of Cursor Rules

Let’s look at a couple of rules you can try in your `.cursor/rules` folder:

### No comments, just code

Sick of extra explanations? Make a file called `no-comments.rule` and add:

```txt
Do not include comments in the generated code. Provide only the functional code itself.
```
> Why? Speeds up workflows when you’re iterating quickly and don’t need explanations.

Now you’ll get straight-up code, no fluff.

### Naming variables

Want variables your way? Create `naming.rule` and write:  

```txt
Use camelCase for all variable names.
```

> So instead of `my_variable`, you’ll see `myVariable`. Cool, right?

These are basic, but they’re perfect for getting a feel for how rules shape the AI’s output.

## Tips for Beginners

- **Start small**: You don’t need a ton of rules. One or two files in `.cursor/rules` can fix the stuff that bugs you most.
- **Keep it simple**: Write rules like you’re chatting with a pal. The AI’s smart enough to get it.
- **Experiment**: Try different rules and see what happens. If it’s not quite right, tweak it—no stress.
- **Have fun**: Rules are here to make coding easier, not harder. Play around and find your groove.

## Wrap-Up

That’s the lowdown on cursor rules in Cursor IDE! With the `.cursor/rules` folder, you’ve got the power to make the AI work *your* way, keeping your coding smooth and fun. So go ahead, set up a rule or two, and **happy coding**!
