# Manifesto for Vibe Coding

We are uncovering a new way of building software by embracing AI, iteration, and human intuition. Through this work, we have come to value:

- **Flow over friction** – Ride the wave, don't fight it.
- **Iteration over perfection** – Perfection is obsolete if you can always reroll.
- **Augmentation over automation** – AI is a collaborator, not a replacement.
- **Product thinking over code crafting** – What matters is what you build, not how you write it.
- **Rerolling over debugging** – If fixing takes too long, regenerate.
- **Human taste over technical constraints** – The best tech serves great taste, not the other way around.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles of Vibe Coding

1. **Focus on the problem, not the code.** Code is just the medium—what matters is solving the right problems.
2. **Taste is the ultimate filter.** AI can generate infinite solutions, but only human judgment can pick the right one.
3. **Systems thinking beats syntax mastery.** The best engineers don't just code—they architect, evaluate, and iterate.
4. **AI is your co-creator.** The best engineers wield AI to amplify their impact, not just automate tasks.
5. **Speed is the new craftsmanship.** The highest priority is delivering valuable software continuously and exponentially faster.
6. **Deliver in minutes, not days.** AI enables a pace where shipping happens as fast as thinking.
7. **Change is fuel.** Welcome new requirements at any stage—flexibility is a superpower, not a burden.
8. **Simplicity scales.** The best way to build fast and flexibly is to maximize what you don't build.
9. **Code is disposable.** If it doesn't work, reroll. Don't get attached.
10. **Favor reinvention over patchwork.** When a solution no longer meets our needs, we embrace regeneration to achieve greater clarity and efficiency.
11. **Optimize for acceleration.** The future belongs to those who build with exponential speed in mind.
12. **Evolve constantly.** Teams should reflect, adapt, and upgrade their tools and workflows regularly.
