The Replit CEO acts like a politician who makes bold statements, knowing they are false. It resembles Trump saying, "Ilegal immigrants are criminals," and he knows only a small percentage are.

Replit advocates "replacing developers" by generating an entire product from one prompt. I think this is impossible to achieve. Here is my reasoning: 

I use Replit daily, and it always misses my original intent in the prompt. But that's okay because we have irrational expectations from AI, and that is why we are always disappointed. 

Like "cloning linkedin" is just doing the HTML/CSS. How much time, money, and A/B tests did LinkedIn spend to arrive at that design? The AI can clone HTML/CSS that already works or generate appealing layouts, but it cannot create engaging designs from nothing.

Building products requires putting yourself in the shoes of your client/user, which is very hard, and the AI has no context for it. No matter how smart you are, you will never develop a product market fit in one, five, or 50 shots.

Also, AI has other challenges, like integration with current systems, different teams, etc.

That is why "merging AI with the developers" is the winning approach against "replacing the developers with AI".

One of my biggest fights while hashtag#vibecoding with AI is keeping consistency.

When I ask the AI to write some code, it will write it in a different way than it did yesterday, or it will duplicate code, or use a new design pattern or a new approach! 😡

🔥 One of the most efficient tricks so far to avoid that, is to take the time to ask the AI to write some rules that apply to the most important files. 

For example: You probably have 5-10 files that are VERY IMPORTANT, we usually call this files "Managers" or "Controllers,” “Coordinators,” “Services,” or even “Core Modules,” depending on the architecture. The name isn’t as important as their role: they’re the files that orchestrate the logic, glue components together, and keep everything humming.

For each of these files you will have one rule file that describe its responsibilities, design patterns, integration patterns, naming conventions, etc.

Of course you are not writing this rules either, the AI will write this for you.

Attached are some examples.
